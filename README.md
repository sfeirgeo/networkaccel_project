# 🚀 Network Acceleration Project

Welcome to my repository where I'm building a **MAC address filter** and **UDP echo system** for the [PYNQ-Z2](https://www.pynq.io/board.html) board by AMD.  
This project leverages both **hardware acceleration (FPGA)** and **software control (Python)** to demonstrate low-level packet filtering and response times in a Zynq-based SoC environment.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- **MAC Filter (SystemVerilog):**  
  Filters Ethernet frames by comparing the destination MAC address to a predefined value. Packets are dropped or passed based on the match.

- **UDP Echo (Python on PYNQ):**  
  Receives valid UDP payloads from the FPGA and sends them back to the original sender using the ARM processor and Linux networking stack.

- **AXI DMA Integration:**  
  High-throughput streaming is achieved using AXI4-Stream + AXI DMA to bridge the programmable logic and the processing system.

## 📈 Key Features

- MAC filtering based on hardcoded 48-bit address (default: `DE:AD:BE:EF:12:34`)
- AXI4 for compatibility with DMA and other streaming IPs
- Compatible with PYNQ overlays for control from Python
